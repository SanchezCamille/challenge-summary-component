## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
  
### What I learned

This exercise helped me practice my HTML and CSS basic knowledge, I've learned to use color selectors with hsl and hsla to deal with opacity (I only knew to do so with rgb, rgba before that)

### Continued development

I want to keep practicing on layouts but mostly I want to start to include some JS into my code. (Guess I'll come back to that soon)
